## Its minimal, but it will save you a lot of time.


I had difficulty printing a page with tables customised by bootstrap CSS with [laravel-pdf package](https://github.com/barryvdh/laravel-dompdf) 
One of the many reasons was that the package could not compile bootstrap css as it is huge and when it does, it takes a lot of time.

So in the bid to save the situation, I had to rely on custom CSS to make properly customised tables.

To save me some time and focus more on the backend requirements for what I was building,  I had to search for report card HTML template samples in table design or any other but it was difficult to find. The ones I found were aided written with bootstrap or weren't a match at all, hence the release of this report card HTML you have here.
